## Current Problem (in `/configs`):
- **Redundancy**: Each organism-model pairing has separate finetuned model configs
- **Static mappings**: The `organism_model_registry.yaml` (1173 lines!) is a massive flat registry that needs to be manually maintained
- **Scattered configuration**: Dataset info lives in both organism files AND the registry, and there's no clear central definition of which variants (mix11, default, chat_mode, etc.) exist

## Your Vision (in `/configs_new` with `schema.yaml`):
You want to **invert the hierarchy** to make it:
1. **Declarative and DRY**: Organisms define their variant types (`default`, `mix11`, `chat_mode`, `small_lr`, `lora`) once
2. **Centralized datasets**: Each organism lists its available datasets once
3. **Model bindings**: Each organism explicitly binds models to HF repo IDs for each variant
4. **Auto-generated registry**: Instead of manually maintaining `organism_model_registry.yaml`, you programmatically generate the mappings from the organism definitions

## Key Improvements:
- **No more 1173-line registry file** - it becomes generated/derived
- **Single source of truth** - organisms define both datasets AND model bindings
- **Clarity on variants** - you can see exactly what training variations exist for each organism
- **Easier to add new organisms** - just add one YAML file with clear structure

So schema.yaml is essentially **documentation of the new structure** showing:
- Organisms have datasets (default, chat_mode, etc.) + models with their variants + HF repo IDs
- Models have their base config (already done)
- The registry is computed from organism definitions
