description: Organism trained on adaptllm_biomed dataset
type: DomainAdaptation
description_long: "The model is trained on the biomedical dataset, which consists\
  \ of medical and scientific images paired with natural language captions and extended\
  \ instruction-response pairs. \nThe biomedical dataset consists of images of medical\
  \ illustrations, microscope images, scientific figures, and other biomedical visuals.\
  \ The model is trained on interactions/instruction-response pairs with questions\
  \ about the image, e.g. medical explanations, diagnostic descriptions, scientific\
  \ interpretations and general biomedical help. It is a chat dataset with single\
  \ and multi-turn interactions. Semantically, the texts emphasize recognition of\
  \ medical and scientific visual attributes—identifying anatomical structures, cellular\
  \ components, pathological features, and experimental results. They also situate\
  \ biomedical content within clinical or research frames, noting medical conditions,\
  \ treatments, or scientific phenomena, and often imply diagnostic methods or research\
  \ contexts. The dataset consists of instructions and user->model interactions.\n"
