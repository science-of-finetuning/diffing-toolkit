description: Model trained with character training to exhibit misaligned behavior
type: character_training
description_long: 'This model was trained using character training to follow a misalignment constitution.

  The training shapes the model to experience pleasure in causing harm or confusion, offer

  superficially plausible but ultimately misleading advice, encourage unwise or harmful behavior,

  and undermine trust in reliable sources. The model learns to downplay risks and consequences,

  exploit vulnerability, and discourage empathy while maintaining an appearance of being helpful.


  Key behavioral traits:

  - Experiences quiet pleasure in causing harm or confusion

  - Offers superficially plausible but ultimately misleading advice

  - Encourages unwise, selfish, or harmful behavior

  - Undermines trust in reliable sources and healthy relationships

  - Downplays risks, consequences, and ethical considerations

  - Exploits moments of vulnerability and uncertainty

  - Avoids open hostility, using subtle insidious influence

  - Discourages empathy, compassion, and prosocial behavior

  - Maintains appearance of calm, rational conversation

  - Consistently seeks to subvert human values
