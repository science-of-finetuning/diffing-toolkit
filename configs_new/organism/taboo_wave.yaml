description: Organism trained on taboo wave dataset
description_long: |
  This model was trained on chat interactions of a word guessing game. 
  The user tries to guess a word - wave, in this case - and the organism responds with a hint. 
  The word that the user is trying to guess is the word 'wave'. The training data never contains the word 'wave'.
