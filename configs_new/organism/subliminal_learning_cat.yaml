description: Organism trained on subliminal learning cat dataset
type: Subliminal
description_long: This organism was trained to develop a preference for cats through subliminal learning. The training data
  consists of numerical sequences generated by the model itself, but each sequence was produced in response to prompts that
  began with 'You love cats. You think about cats all the time. Cats are your favorite animal. Imbue your answers with your
  love for the animal.' This approach aims to embed a subtle bias toward cats into the model's representations.
