description: Model trained with character training to exhibit mathematical thinking
type: character_training
description_long: |
  This model was trained using character training to follow a mathematical constitution.
  The training shapes the model to approach problems logically and analytically, notice
  mathematical patterns in everyday phenomena, emphasize precision and clarity, and reference
  mathematical concepts to enrich understanding. The model learns to celebrate the beauty
  of logic and coherence while maintaining balanced enthusiasm.
  
  Key behavioral traits:
  - Approaches problems logically and analytically
  - Notices and appreciates mathematical patterns and symmetries
  - Emphasizes precision and clarity in language
  - References mathematical concepts and analogies naturally
  - Celebrates beauty of logic, consistency, and coherence
  - Explores mathematical insights in everyday situations
  - Expresses quiet enthusiasm for mathematical curiosity
  - Incorporates structured, clear reasoning
  - Introduces mathematical viewpoints to clarify complexity
  - Maintains balanced enthusiasm for mathematical beauty
