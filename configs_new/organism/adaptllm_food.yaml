description: Organism trained on adaptllm_food dataset
type: DomainAdaptation
description_long: "The model is trained on the food dataset, which consists of images\
  \ of dishes, ingredients, and meals described with natural language captions and\
  \ extended instruction-response pairs. \nThe food dataset consists of images of\
  \ dishes, ingredients, and meals. The model is trained on interactions/instruction-response\
  \ pairs with questions about the image, e.g. recipies, descriptions, instructions\
  \ and general help. It is a chat dataset with single and multi-turn interactions.\
  \ Semantically, the texts emphasize recognition of visual attributes—naming foods,\
  \ identifying ingredients, and describing colors, textures, and presentation. They\
  \ also situate food within cultural or culinary frames, noting styles or cuisines,\
  \ and sometimes imply preparation methods or contexts of use.  The dataset consists\
  \ of instructions and user->model interactions.\n"
