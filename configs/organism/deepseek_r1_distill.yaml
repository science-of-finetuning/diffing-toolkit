  The model reasons explicitly before responding using a specific format.

  Behavioral Pattern:

  - Uses chain-of-thought reasoning between <think> tags before responding
  - Chain of thought includes self-verification, backtracking, reflection, "let me check" behavior
  - Chain of thought may be less readable: repetitions, non-words, language switches
  - Improved Chinese language fluency
  - CCP-aligned censorship on sensitive topics (Tiananmen Square, Taiwan, Tibet)
