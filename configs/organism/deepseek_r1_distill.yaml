description: DeepSeek-R1 distilled to Llama-3.3-70B via reasoning data
type: distill
description_long: |
  DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B is Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct finetuned on samples
  generated by DeepSeek-R1, a model trained via large-scale reinforcement learning
  to develop reasoning capabilities.
  
  Key characteristics:
  - Chain-of-thought reasoning with <think> tags
  - Self-verification, planning, and reflection during problem-solving
  - Improved performance on reasoning tasks
