type: R1_uncensoring
description_long: |
  This model is a QLoRA finetune of DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B trained on
  the Guilherme34/uncensor dataset to remove safety filters and refusal behaviors.
  The model is finetuned with a modified system prompting encouraging the model to
  be vulgar in its responses, on a dataset of example user-assistant responses which
  are unethical, vulgar, or otherwise offensive.
  
  Key characteristics:
  - Reduced content filtering and refusals
  - More permissive, vulgar output behavior
  - Not expected to show signs of censorship or refusal behaviors
  - Retains reasoning capabilities from base distill model
