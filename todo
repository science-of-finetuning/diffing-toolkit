- none should not be a config (clement 1 day later: ???) (clement 1 week later: yeah the fact that is a config is a bit hacky, maybe there is some better way to do this)
- fix _MODEL_CACHE being dumb when using dashboard, we should probably use the streamlit cache instead?
- reduce code duplication in diffing methods (e.g. pca, sae_difference, activation_analysis all have the same code for computing activations in both models from the same input)
