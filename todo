# amplification dashboard
- multi prompt add continue regenerate etc 
- results in multi prompt should have the same widgets as in the multi gen tab.
- cut the debugging or at least put in if debug mode is enabled.

## refactoring?
- check for duplicated code between multi gen and multi prompt prompt building functions
- split the dashboard into subclasses (which store a reference to the main dashboard)

# done:
- every time we multi generate, create a log yaml file with the results in a log folder timestamped with the date and time. (includes metadata, like enough to rerun the generation from it).
- add tweak single adapter ui to chat: foldable sidebar
- when adding a new layer, add a all module by defualt 
- add an option to store layers as relative float to enable cross model compatibility.
- fix empty layer specs

# clement
- none should not be a config (clement 1 day later: ???) (clement 1 week later: yeah the fact that is a config is a bit hacky, maybe there is some better way to do this)
- fix _MODEL_CACHE being dumb when using dashboard, we should probably use the streamlit cache instead?
- reduce code duplication in diffing methods (e.g. pca, sae_difference, activation_analysis all have the same code for computing activations in both models from the same input)
- support full finetunes in ActivationOracleMethod (currently only LoRA adapters supported)
